### Note: for [Love 0.10.2](https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/tag/0.10.2).  It uses 0-255 colour values.

This a simple side scrolling action game.

I made it for my 3 year old because he likes the Hulk, fire trucks and transformers.

## What this has
- infinate side scrolling background in both directions with different backgrounds: city, forest and hills
- The character can transform from a firetruck to the hulk/truck hydrid
- You can aim you water cannon in either form, the truck also has a siren
- Planes periodically drop water or health depending on the need
- There is an auto-aim/shoot for a little easier play if needed
